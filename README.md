# AUDIO SYNTHESIZER

This project is still a WIP and it is my attempt to develop my own synth. Initially simple functions such a piano roll, octave an pitch manipulation as well as oscillator controlls will be implemented. 

## TODO
- Beautify code
- Add ways to control the frequency played from the keyboard
- Add comments around the logic used behind oscillators
